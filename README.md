# PacketPub free book of the day

This was just a script I made to automatically get the [free packetpub book of the day](packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning). Sadly, maybe because of people like me, the script doesnt't work anymore, because packetpub added a "I'm not a robot" nocaptcha. 
It can serve as selenium usage example anyway, so why don't publish it on github?
Be aware that I'm a beginner in python, so this may not be the best way to code this behaviour.
